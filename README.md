# Android_Studio_App
 Your Android Studio-based mobile application consists of three main parts.  The first part provides a parameter with which the user can convert a desired value to binary, octal or hexadecimal bases.  In the second section, the user can convert a specified value into Kilobyte, Byte, Kibibyte or Bit values.  In the third part, Celsius can convert a value to Fahrenheit or Kelvin.  In the second part, there is a number of progress bars to be determined by the user. You can enter the minimum and maximum values of each progress bar and the application can present a simulation by generating random numbers between these values.  In the third part, the user can send an SMS to a phone number he/she has specified.
